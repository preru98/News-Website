              This website, is developed and co-designed by Suraj Sharma, Sparsh Yadav, and Rishabh Dev Dogra, the students at the 
                       Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies. Since these students are themselves technology enthusiasts and
                                vigilant, they tried and developed a website of their own.  Three cornerstone technologies for web i.e 
                                        HTML, CSS  and JS are used by the students to develop this website. For fetching real
                                                    time data, JS WTIA REST API is used from the official site of NewsApi.
